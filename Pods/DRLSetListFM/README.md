## Description
This setlist.fm API cocoapod has been designed to give you easy access to setlist data in order to build fancy applications. This service provides methods to get both setlists and components of setlists such as artists, cities, countries or venues.


## Requirements
... understand how setlist.fm works (the [FAQ](https://www.setlist.fm/faq) and the [Guidelines](https://www.setlist.fm/guidelines) are a good starting point),
... read this documentation carefully and
... [apply for an API key](https://www.setlist.fm/settings/api) link for logged in users only) - if you're no registered user yet, then [register first](https://www.setlist.fm/signup) (it's free).


## Supported Content Types
This pod currently supports JSON content only:
To receive a JSON response, set the 'Accept' header to "application/json".


## Internationalization

The default language is English (en), but you can provide any of the languages Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Portuguese (pt), Turkish (tr), Italian (it) or Polish (pl).


## API Keys
API keys must be included in the request with
the 'x-api-key' header.

## Header Example
