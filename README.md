# Sample_Project

I have included the DRLSetlistFM pod.

I would like to pull from the Class10searchsetlistsAPI with the parameters of CountryCode = "US" and p = 1 (really just need to be a scrollable view) This would allow me to fill the Content View to have reloadable tiles that list the most recent concerts in the US. The tiles would be clickable by the user. I was hoping to have the Artist name, City, State, Date listed in each tile.

If i can figure out how to execute the GET call then i should be able to figure out the search bar in the future. Just not sure how to call the API currently

I have included a test API KEY that i created with a dummy account. (added to the headers in API file in the pod)

Thank you for the help! It means a lot to me!
